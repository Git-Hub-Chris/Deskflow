        The most important part of problem solving is understanding the problem.
        The more detail you provide, the better we can understand your idea.
        “If I had only one hour to save the world, 
        I would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem,
        and only five minutes finding the solution.”
        — Albert Einstein
