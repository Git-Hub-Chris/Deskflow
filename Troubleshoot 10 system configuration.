I have multiple networked devices that I am attempting to get working together. 
A set of which are intended to function as a command center and employ synergy.

*There appears to be server configuration issues for the base station "ANVIL"*

Anvil is a Lenovo M50 series. M57 I think.
Desktop, Win7HomePre 

The wireless router is a supported U-Verse AT&T wireless router.
The Iomega/Lenovo "Home Media" 2terabyte storage device attached to the network.
May be the problem.

After installing both softwares the network went haywire on ANVIL.

The Synergy two client computers ( WHITE, and OWNER ) for the command station are seemingly unaffected.
Tho they are generating the same error in the log.
I have not attempted to alter the Synergy settings at all beyond checking the elevate;
-- which produced no change in any behavior.

Note: Implementing a third ( android ) device would be intruiging.

ANVIL NETWORK HAYWIRE
* UNABLE TO BROWSE *SPECIFICALLY* just the internet and synergy.
* Network task icon indicates internet access.
* Network map panel indicates no problems.
* MS Troubleshooters and fixits indicate no problem.
* CMD Ping command results in no problems.
* NSLookup commands as well indicating no problems.
* Synergy does not work:
** Launching the GUI -> Prior to start the log view repetitively reiterates;
--- NOTE: connecting to service...
--- ERROR: ipc connection error, code=-1
* The web is inaccessible
** All web browsers in all profiles in or out of safe mode cannot find pages.
* In all profiles and all modes the network map indicates no problems.
* In all profiles and all modes ping is functioning fine with any website.
* In all profiles and all modes workgroup network shares are available.

*The Time Line*

ANVIL was working fine and accessing the internet and synergy.
I installed the Iomega/Lenovo "Home Media" drive into the network.
The install CD came with Iomega software. 
After installing the iomega software the iomega software said that I had to install Lenovo software.
I installed the Lenovo Software from an in program prompt.
After installing the LenovoEMC storage management software everything was working fine.
I uninstalled the Iomega network storage management software.
I rebooted ANVIL.
ANVIL no longer connection to the internet but can access the network.
Synergy was still working.
I uninstalled all the network and storage monitoring software from my computer.
Including all network driver controllers.
I installed a new wireless adapter and installed its drivers w/o its ( TP-Linke ) wifi management console.
I have not regained the ability to access the internet/web.
Synergy produces the aforementioned error -- repeatedly -- in its log prior to hitting start.
