"The first incarnation of Synergy was CosmoSynergy, created by Richard Lee "

"Chris Schoeneman contributed, to solve a problem: most of the engineers in "
"Cosmo Software had both an Irix and a Windows box on their desks and "
"switchboxes were expensive and annoying. CosmoSynergy was a great success "
"but Cosmo Software declined to productize it and the company was later "
"closed. Synergy is a from-scratch reimplementation of CosmoSynergy. It "
"provides most of the features of the original and adds a few improvements."

"6 June 2010, the latest release was 2 April 2006). There was never official "
"confirmation that the original Synergy project had been abandoned; however, "
"there was public discussion providing speculation. In said discussion, Chris "
