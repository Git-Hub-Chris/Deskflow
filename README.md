Share one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers, even across operating systems.

Features
--------

 - Cross-platform - supports Windows, Mac, and Linux
 - Clipboard synchronization - Copy text on one computer, paste it on another, Symlessly!
 - Portable - With a little bit of setup, you can deploy the client on any computer from a flash drive, even without admin rights.
 - Zeroconf - Autodiscovery within a subnet, so you don't need to configure anything for most uses.
